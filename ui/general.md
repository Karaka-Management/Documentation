# General UI

## Dark mode

Some users prefer to use the darkmode of a website. Unfortunately due to the way Windows settings work it is no longer feasible to automatically provide the dark mode based on these settings. However, you may enable dark mode by adding `&darkmode` or `?darkmode` at the end of the url.

> Dark mode is only experimental and we recommend useres to use the default theme
